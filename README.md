### SVD-Audio-Compression
This project focuses on utilizing Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) for audio compression. The aim is to develop techniques that
efficiently reduce the size of audio files while maintaining high sound quality, leveraging the mathematical properties of SVD to achieve significant compression ratios
without compromising the integrity of the audio. This involves experimenting with
different levels of decomposition and reconstruction to find the optimal balance between compression ratio and audio fidelity.
